# SHIS
Smart Home for the Impaired Speech Using Alexa Device SDK, OpenCV and GOOGLE's MediaPipe

## Introduction
Smart Home for the Impaired Speech (SHIS) is a software designed to help people with speech disabilities gain access to smart home features that usually require voice activation. By using hand gestures, users can control smart home devices such as lights, thermostats, door locks, etc.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the SHIS program on your Raspberry Pi.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have a Raspberry Pi with a camera module installed and that it is connected to the internet.

### Step 1: Install AVS Device SDK

1. Follow the instructions to install the AVS Device SDK on your Raspberry Pi. The SDK allows the device to utilize Amazon Alexa Voice Service.
2. For detailed installation instructions, visit [Amazon Developer Guide](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/avs-device-sdk-1-2x/raspberry-pi-script.html).

### Step 2: Install Pulse Audio

1. Install Pulse Audio, which is a sound server used to manage audio input and output on your device.
2. Pulse Audio will help in creating a virtual microphone to capture the audio signals for AVS.
3. Run following commands:
```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update
```
```bash
# Install PulseAudio
sudo apt install pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils
```

### Step 3: Add OpenCV Library

1. Add the OpenCV library to your system. OpenCV is used for image and video analysis and will help in recognizing the hand gestures through the camera feed.
2. First we need to get the Prerequesites by executing following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config libjpeg-dev libtiff5-dev libjasper-dev libpng-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libfontconfig1-dev libcairo2-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran libhdf5-dev libhdf5-serial-dev libhdf5-103 python3-pyqt5 python3-dev -y
```
3. Install OpenCV library with the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-opencv
```

### Step 4: Add Google's MediaPipe Library and Dependencies

1. Install Google's MediaPipe library, a framework for building multimodal (e.g., video, audio, any time-series data) applied machine learning pipelines.
2. MediaPipe will be responsible for the gesture recognition process.
3. First Clone MediaPipe's repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/googlesamples/mediapipe.git
```
4. Run following commands to get task file and install required dependecies
```bash
cd mediapipe/examples/gesture_recognizer/raspberry_pi
sh setup.sh
```
### Step 5: Clone the SHIS Repository

1. Clone the SHIS repository from GitHub to your local machine by running this command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DoumitC/SHIS.git
```
### Step 6: Navigate to Repo Folder and run setup.sh

1. Run following commands to run scipt that compiles C++ main file:
```bash
cd SHIS
./setup.h
```
   
### Step 7: Run autorun.sh

1. While still in Repo Folder.
2. Run the autorun script to start the program by running the following commands:
```bash
./autorun.sh
```
### Step 8: Register Device with Amazon Account

1. If this is your first time running the program, execute it from the terminal and follow the on-screen instructions to register your device with your Amazon account.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation and setup, use the predefined hand gestures to control your smart home devices through Alexa. Ensure that your gestures are within the camera's field of view for accurate recognition.

This program is preconfigured with specific hand gesture commands that interact with smart home features. Below are the default settings:

- **Open Palm**: Triggers a request for the current weather.
- **Thumbs Up**: Asks for the current time.
- **I Love You (sign language gesture)**: Begins playing music.
- **Closed Fist**: Stops any ongoing action or music playback.

If you wish to modify the commands associated with each gesture, you can edit the `main.cpp` file with your preferred configurations. After making your changes, please run `setup.sh` to recompile the program and apply the new settings. This ensures that your adjustments are correctly integrated into the system.

```bash
cd SHIS
./setup.sh
```
